# A tour of .Net

## Major features of .Net

* __Garbage Collection__: Automatically reclaims memory occupied by unused objects
* __Exception Handing__: Provides a structured and extensible approach to error detection and recovery
* __Type-safe__: Makes uninitialized variables cannot be read, makes index out of boundary cannot beyond.
* __Unify System__: primitive types (int float) inherited from a single root **Object**. So all types can keeps consistent manners. C# also supports user defined reference types to allow dynamic allocation of objects as well as in-line storage of lightweight structures.
* __Version__: libraries can evolved over time in a compatible manner by using **Virtual** and **Override**.
